abstract: Given the JP Morgan and the London Whale Case, there are two specific points that I consider taking away. Firstly, when you are responsible of managing an investment team for the account of clients, you need to control their actions regarding the assets management directives and also if they complied to the regulations. Agency problem usually happens between the CIO and the portfolio managers or investment teams. The portfolio managers wanted to maximize their return and they exposed their portfolio to more risks while the CIO might ask them to reduce investments.

## JP Morgan & London Whale
I have chosen the industry of portfolio management with a focus on the investment advisor, broadly the investment sector. Investment advisors and portfolio managers do not always comply to fiduciary duties that compel the advisors to work prudently in the best interests of the clients. The general lesson to take away from the case is that it is very important to set check and balance around big risk-takers in the investment sector. They might incur huge losses by deviating from the parameters that limit the exposure of the company to risks. 
Given the JP Morgan and the London Whale Case, there are two specific points that I consider taking away. Firstly, when you are responsible of managing an investment team for the account of clients, you need to control their actions regarding the assets management directives and also if they complied to the regulations. Agency problem usually happens between the CIO and the portfolio managers or investment teams. The portfolio managers wanted to maximize their return and they exposed their portfolio to more risks while the CIO might ask them to reduce investments. This is exactly what happened in the case of Bruno Iksil and Drew. Drew gave the mandate to reduce the RWA exposure while the investment team had greatly ramped up the size and risk of the portfolio to levels not previously seen. Secondly, finding a way to address risks and provide a structure that can prevent losses is a simple procedure. They came up with different metrics such VaR, Csv1 and Csv10%. But they set up the risk levels to notify the CEO. In the line below, I will talk about what keeps senior management awake at night in the investment business.
In the investment industry, senior managers are very concerned about keeping the trust of the clients, especially in a volatile market, and do what it takes to make the company grow. Sometimes, teams are taking initiatives to grow their portfolio at the detriment of the clients. Senior managers are always in the meeting discussing with their teams to define new resolutions against the volatility of the market in order to prevent loss and reduce the risk of losses. The competitors are also providing products or assets a firm might not provide. When your clients are ready to join these new competitors, senior managers are worried about not losing clients to their new competitors. Innovation can be very disruptive to the markets. Senior managers are scared when new technology is coming into the market. Clients tend, at last, to turn to new technology for investment because of low costs.
The main obstacle to overcome is the strict supervision of the investment team who is investing and managing the portfolio for the interest of clients. All of them actions need to be approved by a committee so that investments complied with the regulations of the company and the risk exposure. Senior managers need also to be very innovative in case they want to remain in the market.
