Abstract: It pertains to the Federal Reserves' mandate to regulate the financial market and also to intervene when a financial institution, specially when it is too big, to help from going bankrupt. The financial institutions that are too big to fail might collapse the economy if they happens to fail. In the light of this case, we will share our opinions at different levels in a concise manner.

The Fed decided to let Lehman Brothers fail, some said it was cruel on part of the Fed not to bail out that giant bank, but others disagreed with this view. I am one of those who think the Fed made the right decision. In the line below, we will support our views based on certain considerations. Doing so, we will refer to the case for context.
The Lehman Brothers represented one of the 5 global investment banks on Wall Street  along with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bearn Stearns. Logically, it is obvious that the fall of Lehman Brothers would bring chaos in the financial sector. In the sense, that the commercial paper and credit default swap will be severely impacted. Explicitly, investors who bet against firms defaulting on payments to investors regardless the financial instruments were prone to lose money because of Lehman Brothers’ crash. Since Lehman was very big in CDS.. If Lehman was bailed out by Fed, the financial crisis would have not worsened. 
It is important to support my position that the government made the right decision by letting Lehman Brothers fail. You might have argued that the mission of the Fed is to restore stability in the financial market and to provide all sorts of assistance to big investment banks to prevent them from failing because their failure might disrupt the financial market. I would say that the Fed made the right decision to let Lehman go bankrupt. The factors that brought the Fed to not bail out Lehman brothers boiled down to a combination of political, financial, and social pressures 
The Fed had already taken extensive creative measures to increase the flow of credit in the financial system. In 2008, there has been a financial crisis. The Fed had already recapitalized 75% of the financial system to contain in a significant way. To the Fed, Lehman was worth letting go to spare something bigger, which was the economy. There’s also political and social pressure. To Americans, it looked like the Fed was bailing out the “crooked Wall Streeters” who were too busy risking the life savings of average families. To a few political congressmen, it felt like it was destroying the very foundation of the American economy if the Fed bailed out Lehman.
Lehman Brothers was not the only investment bank in trouble. Merrill Lynch was in the same sinking boat. The Fed would not be able to save both. They had to choose one of them. It had to be Merrill because Merrill was bigger for financial reasons.
The first reason to consider is the moral hazard.  The Fed is the lender of last resort and then can provide emergency bailout. The Fed could have bailed Lehman out, but it would create a moral hazard. Imagine the Fed is rescuing every time banks failed. They would not take the appropriate measures to protect themselves against the risks or limit their risks.
