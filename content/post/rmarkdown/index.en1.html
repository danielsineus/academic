subtitle: "Welcome \U0001F44B We don't create our feelings; they simply come to us, and we have to accept them. The trick is, to welcome them- **hector Garcia Puigcerver**"
summary: "Welcome \U0001F44B Ikigai originates from an unlikely place. The island of Okinawa was, after all, a place of extreme suffering during World War II, with over 200,000 casualties (Garcia & Miralles, 2017). The Battle of Okinawa was the most devastating land battle of the Pacific war (Tzeng, 2000).

Yet, somehow, many decades later, the location of this bloodbath has become known for something else far better. Namely, in today’s Okinawa, there are more people over the age of 100 than in any other place on Earth (Garcia & Miralles, 2017). Not only do Okinawans live incredibly long and healthy lives, but their lives are replete with happiness, serenity, camaraderie, and plenty of activity"

<h1>My version of <strong><em>Ikigai</em></strong> : its real meaning</h1>
<p>You might have known this concept before, in case you have not. Let me do you the honor to briefly mention where the word comes from and what it means. Ikigai originates from an unlikely place. The island of Okinawa was, after all, a place of extreme suffering during World War II, with over 200,000 casualties (Garcia &amp; Miralles, 2017). The Battle of Okinawa was the most devastating land battle of the Pacific war (Tzeng, 2000).</p>
<p>Yet, somehow, many decades later, the location of this bloodbath has become known for something else far better. Namely, in today’s Okinawa, there are more people over the age of 100 than in any other place on Earth (Garcia &amp; Miralles, 2017). Not only do Okinawans live incredibly long and healthy lives, but their lives are full with happiness, serenity, camaraderie, and plenty of activity. In a nutshell, Ikigai is the way to get to live a healthy life in a multidimentional way.</p>
<div id="on-my-way-to-find-ikigai" class="section level2">
<h2>On my way to find <strong><em>Ikigai</em></strong> ?</h2>
<p>For the past 2 years, I have picked an intense curiosity as an amateur for Data Science, or on a much reduced term, Data Analysis. It is important to recount how I started and how much effort I made to master this sort of skill. I started with R because I wanted to start programming after a class I took in college. It was C programming. I saw how the repetitive tasks could be codified in some lines. Those lines were executed in a split second every time we have to repeat these tasks. It was cool and easy! Another thing, I also experienced how slow Excel could be when dealing with a lot of rows of data. I wanted to circumvent this little problem.
To do so, first I learned R programming by myself. Truly, I am still learning capable it to be more capable at it. I downloaded every piece of R and Python related contents that I could come across to learn about R. I watched tutorials on youtube. I sometimes met with people with experience in R and participated in Conference to give me extra push about R. I spent so much time learning this particular tool that my wife complained about spending too much time on my laptop. She thought that I was not balancing my leisure time and my time to learn R. Oftentimes I had been reminded that I got addicted to computer. One thing she didn’t realize is that I was having another leisure. I was in the living room watching TV while I had my laptop on my lap practicing data analysis with R. I used to stay late after work hours to learn that tool. Since I was not using R at work, I downloaded data on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/</a> to manipulate them with R or Python.
After learning R, I didn’t take time to dive myself into learning Python for the same purpose, Data Analysis, which I am still learning. I took classes online on Datacamp for Python. I developed the same learning pattern for Python as well as R. Six months ago, I bought books about R and Python in order to sharpen these skills.</p>

<h2>Self Achievement and Hapiness through skills</h2>
<p>IN my previous job, I was known as someone who was good at doing data analysis efficiently and fast on Excel. In my former job, colleagues and superiors used to turn to me when they wanted to do a complicated spreadsheet or manipulated a lot of data and didn’t know the right function or formula to get to the results that they wanted. That was one of the things that I was more approached.
Besides knowing a great deal of R when it comes to Data Analysis, I feel that I need to improve my skills to higher level of competency. I guess for this, I would need to find the right financial positions that would enable to put that skill to use. I am working on that to get there! If there is one or two things in my bucket list right now, it would be getting <strong>CFA</strong> status and learn about <strong>machine learning</strong> in Finance by using R and Python. The end to this would be to market myself and my ideas better. I would take great joy and pride to work in FINTECH or anywhere where coalescing Finance and Data Science is possible (more quantitative analysis). I come to realize that Ikigai is about combining your passion with your skills, but to discover your passion through your skills that are profitable to yourself.</p>

<div id="what-can-i-get-paid-for-before" class="section level2">
<h2>What can I get paid for before?</h2>
<p>In fact, I have been paid before as working on my profession, which is Finance. I’ve never intended to make money out of this particular skill, Data Analytics, but I believe it can be a cross-functional skill for my profession “finance”. It will add value to my competence and might make me negotiate better salary or I can side-hustle with it.I can take it to the next level where I can join FinTECH or travel the world to lead or do training workshop, Forum, and training about the contents abd breakthrough I have created.I could create algorithmic platform to maximize profit investments on derivatives, Stocks and bonds… It might be an asset that stands me out from my peers. This way I can be perceived as a valuable asset. The more I can contribute, the better I will feel. If I get rewarded for combining my data analysis skills with Finance, I will be happy. That will be my Ikigai. I really want to be paid for both.</p>

<h2>What does the world need? How can I contribute to create a positive effect on those around you?</h2>
<p>Six month ago, I started realizing that my scanty knowledge of R and Python should be shared with the world, mostly people who are learning R and Python for the purpose of Data Analytics. There is a virtual community on Github.com . I made my code public so that I share my codes with beginners. I developed tutorials on this website. I would take it to the next level by combining my passion with my profession “Finance”. Very soon, I feel the urge of recording some sessions of coding showing how to analyze financial stocks and upload the videos on youtube as tutorials. Fortunately, I know how to use zoom. Right my Ikigai is not adjusted. But very soon, I will find it. These are my projects where I make my code public.</p>
